# Steak & Sake
This was originally a homework assignment from bootcamp, I revisted it to add more functionality. 

## Launching the site
Go to https://j91branson.github.io/SteakSake/ ( You might have to refresh the page first)

## Functionality
- You will be asked if you eat steak, answers can be yes or no; capitalized or all lowercase. There is a default response if the user answer is not one of those four.
- Then it will ask you your birthday, proper format is YYYY, if you are 21 or older you get a free sake; if not you get soda. The default value for answers not matching the format is also soda.
- Then it will print a message to the screen telling you to enjoy your meal , and what it consists of; values are pulled from an array created as the user answers the questions.
